# GSMINRES++

A high-performance solver library for generalized shifted linear systems using MINRES method.

## Overview

This library solves multiple shifted linear systems of the form:

$$ (A + \sigma^{(m)}B)x^{(m)} = b, \quad (m=1, 2, \dots, M)

where \( A \) is Hermitian (or real symmetric) matrix and \( B \) is positive definite Hermitian (or real symmetric) matrices.
